# BladeOne
BladeOne is a standalone version of Blade Template Engine that uses a single php file and can be ported and used in different projects.

# Introduction (From Laravel webpage)
Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views. All Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade view files use the .blade.php file extension and are typically stored in the resources/views directory.

# About this version
By standard, Blade is part of Laravel (Illuminate components) and for to use it, you requires to install Laravel and Illuminate-view components.
Blade as a template engine is pretty nice and clear. Also it generates a (some that) clean code. And its starting to be considered a de-facto template system for php (Smarty has been riding off the sunset since years ago). So, if we are able to use it without Laravel then its a big plus for many projects. In fact, in theory its is even possible to use with Laravel.
Exists different version of Blade Template that runs without Laravel but most requires 50 or more files and those templates add a new level of complexity:

- More files to manages.
- Changes to the current project (if you want to integrate the template into an existent one)
- Incompatibilities amongst other projects.
- Slowness (if your server is not using op-cache)
- Most of the code in the original Blade is used for future use, including the chance to use a different template engine.
- Some Laravel legacy code.

This project uses a single file called BladeOne.php and a single class (called BladeOne). If you want to use it then include it, creates the folders and that's it!. Nothing more (not even namespaces)*[]: 

# Why to use it instead of native PHP?

## Separation of concerns
Let’s say that we have the next code

```php
<?php
//some php code
// some html code
// more php code
// more html code.
?>
```
It leads to a mess of a code.  For example, let’s say that we oversee changing the visual layout of the page. In this case, we should change all the code and we could even break part of the programming.   
Instead, using a template system works in the next way:
```php
<?php
// some php code
ShowTemplate();
?>
```
We are separating the visual layer from the code layer.  As a plus, we could assign a non-php-programmer in charge to edit the template, and he/she doesn’t need to touch or know our php code.
## Security
Let’s say that we have the next exercise (it’s a dummy example)
```php
<?php
$name=@$_GET[‘name’];
Echo “my name is “.$name;
?>
```
It could be separates as two files:
```php
<?php // index.php
$name=@$_GET[‘name’];
Include “template.php”
?>
```
```php 
<?php // template.php
Echo “my name is “.$name;
?>
```
Even for this simple example, there is a risk of hacking.   How?  A user could sends malicious code by using the GET variable, such as html or even javascript. The second file should be written as follow:
```php 
<?php // template.php
Echo “my name is “.html_entities($name);
?>
```
html_entities should be used in every single part of the visual layer (html) where the user could injects malicious code, and it’s a real tedious work.   BladeOne does it automatically.
```php 
// template.blade.php
My name is {{$name}}
```
## Easy to use

BladeOne is focused in templates and the syntax of the code is aiming to be clean.

Let's consider the next template:

```php // template.php
<select>
    <? foreach($countries as $c) { ?>
        <option value=<? echo html_entities($c->value); ?> > <? echo html_entities($c->text); ?></option>
    <? } ?>
</select>
```
With BladeOne, we could do the same with
```php // template.blade.php
<select>
    @foreach($countries as $c)
        <option value={{$c->value}} >{{echo html_entities($c->text)}}</option>
    @nextforeach
</select>
```
And with html extension we could even reduce to

```php // template.blade.php
@select('id1')
    @items($countries,'value','text','','')
@endselect()
```




## Performance  

This library works in two stages.   

The first is when the template is called the first time. In this case, the template is compiled and stored in a folder.   
The second time the template is called then, it uses the compiled file.   The compiled file consist mainly in native PHP, so **the performance is equals than native code.** since the compiled version IS PHP.

## Scalable

You could add and use your own function by adding a new method (or extending) to the bladeone class. NOTE: The function should starts with the name "compile"
```php
protected function compileMyFunction($expression)
{
    return $this->phpTag . "echo 'YAY MY FUNCTION IS WORKING'; ?>";
}
```

Where the function could be used in a template as follow
```php
@myFunction('param','param2'...)
```
Alternatively, BladeOne allows to run arbitrary code from any class or method if its defined.
```php
{{SomeClass::SomeMethod('param','param2'...)}}
```


# Usage
example.php:
```php
<?php
include "BladeOne.php";
Use eftec\bladeone;

$views = __DIR__ . '/views';
$cache = __DIR__ . '/cache';
define("BLADEONE_MODE",1); // (optional) 1=forced (test),2=run fast (production), 0=automatic, default value.
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache);
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```

_Or using composer's autoload.php_
```php
<?php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

Use eftec\bladeone;

$views = __DIR__ . '/views';
$cache = __DIR__ . '/cache';
define("BLADEONE_MODE",1); // (optional) 1=forced (test),2=run fast (production), 0=automatic, default value.
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache);
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```
_(modify composer.json as follow) and run "composer update"_
```json
"autoload": {
  "psr-4": {
    "eftec\\": "vendor/eftec/"
  }
}
```  

Where $views is the folder where the views (templates not compiled) will be stored. 
$cache is the folder where the compiled files will be stored.

In this example, the BladeOne opens the template **hello**. So in the views folders it should exists a file called **hello.blade.php**

views/hello.blade.php:
```html
<h1>Title</h1>
{{$variable1}}
```

# Business Logic/Controller methods

## constructor
```php
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache);
```
- BladeOne(templatefolder,compiledfolder) Creates the instance of BladeOne.
-   templatefolders indicates the folder (without ending backslash) of where the template files (*.blade.php) are located.
-   compiledfolder indicates the folder where the result of files will be saves. This folder should has write permission. Also, this folder could be located outside of the Web Root.



## run
```php
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```
- run([template,[array])  Runs the template and generates a compiled version (if its required), then it shows the result.
-   template is the template to open. The dots are used for to separate folders.  If the template is called "folder.example" then the engine tries to open the file "folder\example.blade.php"
-   array (optional). Indicates the values to use for the template.  For example ['v1'=>10'], indicates the variable $v1 is equals to 10

## BLADEONE_MODE (global constant) (optional)
```php
define("BLADEONE_MODE",1); // (optional) 1=forced (test),2=run fast (production), 0=automatic, default value.
```
- BLADEONE_MODE Is a global constant that defines the behaviour of the engine.
-   1=forced. Indicates that the engine always will compile the template.
-   2=fast. Indicates that the engine always will use the compiled version


# Template tags

## Template Inheritance

## In the master page (layout)
|Tag|Note|status|
|---|---|---|
|@section('sidebar')|Start a new section|0.2b ok|
|@show|Indicates where the content of section will be displayed|0.2 ok|

## loop

### @for($variable;$condition;$increment) / @endfor
_Generates a loop until the condition is meet and the variable is incremented for each loop_   

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$variable|is a variable that should be initialized.|$i=0|  
|$condition|is the condition that must be true, otherwise the cycle will end.|$i<10|
|$increment|is how the variable is incremented in each loop.|$i++|

Example:   
```html
@for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++)
    The current value is {{ $i }}<br>
@endfor
```
Returns:   
```html
The current value is 0
The current value is 1
The current value is 2
The current value is 3
The current value is 4
The current value is 5
The current value is 6
The current value is 7
The current value is 8
The current value is 9
```

### @foreach($array as $alias) / @endforeach
Generates a loop for each values of the variable.    

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$array|Is an array with values.|$countries|  
|$alias|is a new variable that it stores each interaction of the cycle.|$country|

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@foreach($users as $user)
    This is user {{ $user->id }}
@endforeach
```
Returns:
```html
This is user 1
This is user 2
```

### @forelse($array as $alias) / @empty / @endforelse
Its the same than foreach but jumps to the @empty tag if the array is null or empty   

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$array|Is an array with values.|$countries|  
|$alias|is a new variable that it stores each interaction of the cycle.|$country|


Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@forelse($users as $user)
    <li>{{ $user->name }}</li>
@empty
    <p>No users</p>
@endforelse
```
Returns:
```html
John Doe
Anna Smith
```

### @while($condition) / @endwhile
Loops until the condition is not meet.

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$condition|The cycle loops until the condition is false.|$counter<10|  


Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@set($whilecounter=0)
@while($whilecounter<3)
    @set($whilecounter)
    I'm looping forever.<br>
@endwhile
```
Returns:
```html
I'm looping forever.
I'm looping forever.
I'm looping forever.
```

### @splitforeach($nElem,$textbetween,$textend="")  inside @foreach
This functions show a text inside a @foreach cycle every "n" of elements.  This function could be used when you want to add columns to a list of elements.   
NOTE: The $textbetween is not displayed if its the last element of the last.  With the last element it show the variable $textend

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$nElem|Number of elements|2, for every 2 element the text is displayed|  
|$textbetween|Text to show|'</tr><tr>'| 
|$textend|Text to show|'</tr>'| 

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
<table border="1">
<tr>
@foreach($drinks7 as $drink)
    <td>{{$drink}}</td>
    @splitforeach(2,'</tr><tr>','</tr>')
    @endforeach
</table>
```
Returns a table with 2 columns.

### @continue / @break
Continue jump to the next iteraction of a cycle.  @Break jump out of a cycle.

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@foreach($users as $user)
    @if($user->type == 1) // ignores the first user John Smith
    @continue
    @endif
    <li>{{ $user->type }} - {{ $user->name }}</li>

    @if($user->number == 5) // ends the cycle.
        @break
    @endif
@endforeach
```
Returns:
```html
2 - Anna Smith
```

## @set (new for 1.5)
@set($variable=[value])
@set($variable) is equals to @set($variable=$variable+1)
- $variable define the variable to add. If not value is defined the it adds +1 to a variable.
- value (option) define the value to use.

## Service Inject

#Differences between Blade and BladeOne

- Laravel's extension removed.
- Dependencies to other class removed (around 30 classes).
- The engine is self contained.
- Setter and Getters removed. Instead, we are using the PHP style (public members).
- BladeOne doesn't support static calls.

# Differences between Blade+Laravel and BladeOne+BladeOneHTML

Instead of use the Laravel functions, for example Form::select
```html
{{Form::select('countryID', $arrayCountries,$countrySelected)}}
```

We have native tags as @select,@item,@items and @endselect
```html
@select('countryID')
    @item('0','--Select a country--',$countrySelected)
    @items($arrayCountries,'id','name',$countrySelected)
@endselect()
```

This new syntaxis add an (optionally) a non-selected row.
Also, BladeOneHTML adds multiple select, fixed values (without array), grouped select and many more.
